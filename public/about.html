<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>An aspiring, self-taught web developer. I started learning front-end web development on June 2024.
  I'm still learning and currently I'm studying CSS, and Javascript.
</p>

<p>Born on August 5, 1998 at Binan, Laguna, I grew up knowing nothing about computers or any gadgets until my mom bought me a Gameboy Advance then PlayStation Portable. 
  It was then that I got curious on how games are made and from that day on I decided to learn about programming and got more interested in designing webs.""
</p>

<p>I have worked for the BPO industry for 3 and a half years now, and I wanted to pursue my passion on programming and web development. Want to know more about me? Feel free to contact me on the "Contact me" details.</p>
